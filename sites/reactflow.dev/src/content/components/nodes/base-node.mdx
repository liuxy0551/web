# Base Node

A node wrapper with some basic styling used for creating a shared design among all nodes in your application.
Similarly to [shadcn ui's card](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/card) the components file exports:

- The `BaseNode` main container,
- The `BaseNodeHeader` container where you would usually add actions and a `BaseNodeHeaderTitle`
- The `BaseNodeContent` container where you would add the main contents of the node.
- The `BaseNodeFooter` container where you may want to add extra information, or visible actions.

In case you need to fine-tune how interactions like dragging and scrolling work with your custom components, 
React Flow provides [several CSS utility classes](/learn/customization/utility-classes)

You should use the `nodrag` [React Flow utility class](/learn/customization/utility-classes)
interactive components of your node such as buttons, to disable dragging
the node inside the flow when the user is interactive with buttons or sliders that you may
want to add in your custom node.

Here below, you can find a simple example of three custom nodes, using the `BaseNode` components.

- On the left, the most simple example of a `BaseNode`. 
- On the right, a complete example of a custom node with header, content, footer and a dropdown menu for actions.
- Above the latter, a custom, annotation-like styled `BaseNode` with an icon and number.

## Theming

To customize the visual appearance of your custom nodes, you can simply use
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) classes. All of the React Flow
components are based on [shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/), and you should follow
the [shadcn UI theming guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming) to customize aspects like typography and colors
in your application.

In most occasions though, when developing custom nodes, you may simply need to
add custom Tailwind CSS classes. All of the `BaseNode` components are just light wrappers around `<div>`.

For example, to change the border color of a node, based on an hypothetical execution status,
you can pass extra `className`s:

```tsx
// Assuming your component is receiving a `data` prop
export const BaseNodeSimpleDemo = memo(({ data }: NodeProps) => {
  return (
    <BaseNode
      className={cn('w-[350px] p-0 hover:ring-orange-500', {
        'border-orange-500': data.status === 'loading',
        'border-red-500': data.status === 'error',
      })}
    >
      {/* Your custom node definiton goes here */}
    </BaseNode>
  );
});
```
