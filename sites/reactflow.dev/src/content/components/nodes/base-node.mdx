# Base Node

A node wrapper with some basic styling used for creating a shared design among all nodes in your application.
Similarly to [shadcn ui's card](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/card) the components file exports:

- The `BaseNode` main container,
- The `BaseNodeHeader` container where you would usually add actions and a `BaseNodeHeaderTitle`
- The `BaseNodeContent` container where you would add the main contents of the node.
- The `BaseNodeFooter` container where you may want to add extra information, or visible actions.

You should use the `nodrag` [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) utility
class on buttons and interactive components of your node, to disable dragging
the node inside the flow, for example when clicking on buttons or sliders that you may
want to add in the your custom node.
