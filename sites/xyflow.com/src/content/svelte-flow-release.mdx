Man, the kids grow up so fast. It feels like yesterday when Svelte Flow was taking its first steps, and then bam ‚Äì it has become a full-grown library, complaining about our lame music taste...

And like any decent coming-of-age flick, there are some bumps along the way before you see the end credits roll over the sunset. For us, this meant rewriting Svelte Flow **twice** before landing where we are today. And it is better than ever! A good chunk of the glow-up comes from new possiblities in Svelte 5 and the rest comes down to building a Svelte library from the ground up.

While there are many things to unpack about our journey with Svelte 5, that's a story for another day.

### TL;DR

<div style={{ marginTop: -10 }} />

Svelte Flow 1.0 is here. The docs received a complete overhaul.

<div style={{ marginTop: -10 }} />

- Written from the ground up for Svelte 5
- Feature parity with React Flow for present and upcoming features
- Overhauled learn section
- Automatically generated API references
- Better DX via TSDoc comments

# New features

One of the goals of our first major release, was to close the last remaining gaps between Svelte Flow & React Flow. For us, this also marks a new commitment to develop new features for both libraries in tandem. So keep your eyes peeled for future releases! üëÄ

In the meantime, let's take a look at some of the new things you can do with Svelte Flow today.

## Reconnecting Edges

You can reconnect your edges by using the new `<EdgeReconnectAnchor />` component. It can be used to add custom reconnection points on custom edges. Try it out below!

<Bleed>
  <RemoteCodeViewer
    route="examples/edges/reconnect-edge"
    framework="svelte"
    showEditor={false}
  />
</Bleed>

## Click Connect

You can now create a new connection by clicking on a handle one by one.

<Bleed>
  <RemoteCodeViewer
    route="examples/edges/click-connect"
    framework="svelte"
    showEditor={false}
  />
</Bleed>

## Improved `fitView`

## Key Navigation & A11y

## Enhanced Viewport Portal

# Embracing runes

To create a stable API for the future, we fully embraced signals by converting all [stores](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/stores) to [runes](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/what-are-runes). This allowed us to simplify many parts of the library and make it more performant. Here is a quick overview of some changes to keep in mind when upgrading.

<Callout type="info">
  For a complete rundown of all changes, head over to our [migration guide](/).
</Callout>

## `nodes` & `edges` now use `$state.raw` ü¶Å

[`$state.raw`](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/$state#$state.raw) makes nodes and edges immutable, which [improves performance](https://svelte.dev/playground/e6f804ba6da348bc8b6a0a13c59672cb?version=5.19.0) and allows us to better reason about state updates. Additionally, [binding](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/$bindable) expresses the contract behind `nodes` & `edges` passed to `<SvelteFlow />` more explicitly.

**Old API**

```svelte
<script>
  const nodes = writable([...]);
  const edges = writable([...]);

  const updatePosition = () => {
    nodes.forEach((node) => {
      if (node.id === 'someID') {
        node.position.x += 10;
      }
    });
    nodes = nodes;
  };
</script>

<SvelteFlow {nodes} {edges} />
```

**New API**

```svelte
<script>
  let nodes = $state.raw([...]);
  let edges = $state.raw([...]);

  const updatePosition = () => {
    nodes = nodes.map((node) => {
      if (node.id === 'someID') {
        return {
          ...node,
          position: {
            ...node.position,
            x: node.position.x + 10,
          },
        };
      }
      return node;
    });
  };
</script>

<SvelteFlow bind:nodes bind:edges />
```

## Hooks return reactive values instead of `writable`

Many of our hooks that used to return a store, now return a reactive value that can be accessed via `.current`.

```svelte
<script>
  import { useNodeConnections } from '@xyflow/svelte';

  const connections = useNodeConnections({ handleType: 'target', handleId: 'my-handle' });

  $inspect(connections.current);
</script>
```

## Events are lowercase & HTML attributes exposed

Following the new [Svelte 5 convention](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/v5-migration-guide#Event-changes), all event callbacks are now lowercase.
Plus, as a result of the [new way rest props](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/$props#Rest-props) can be passed on to HTML elements, almost all components now expose the props of the underlying parent element.

```svelte
<!-- Svelte Flow callbacks & root <div/> props -->
<SvelteFlow
  onnodeclick={handleNodeClick}
  onbeforedelete={handleBeforeDelete}
  onbeforeconnect={handleBeforeConnect}
  [...]
  ondragover={handleDragOver}
  ondrop={handleDrop}
  oncontextmenu={handleContextMenu}
/>
```
