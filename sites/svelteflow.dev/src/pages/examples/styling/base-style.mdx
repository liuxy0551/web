<ExampleLayout>
Svelte Flow comes with a default style and a minimal base style (used in this example). The base style is mandatory for a flow to work. You can find more information about how to style a flow in the [theming guide](/learn/guides/theming).

<RemoteCodeViewer
  route="examples/styling/base-style"
  
  framework="svelte"
/>
