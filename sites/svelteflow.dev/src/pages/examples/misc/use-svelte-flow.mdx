<ExampleLayout>
The `useSvelteFlow` hook gives you access to the Svelte Flow store and provides some functions for updating the viewport. The hook only has access to the store if it is called in a descendent of the main `<SvelteFlow />` component or inside a custom node or edge or a component.
To extend access, wrap your application with the `<SvelteFlowProvider />` component. It grants all children and descendents access to the store and hooks.

<RemoteCodeViewer
  route="examples/misc/use-svelte-flow"
  framework="svelte"
  activeFile="Flow.svelte"
/>

</ExampleLayout>
