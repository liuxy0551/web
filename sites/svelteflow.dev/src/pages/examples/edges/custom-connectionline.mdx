<ExampleLayout>
A Connection Line is the edge that appears when you click on a handle and drag. It represents a possible edge and can snap to other valid handles in close proximity.
You can implement your own Connection Line by passing a snippet to the `connectionLine` prop. We do not pass any additional props to the snippet as the `useConnection` hook gives you access to the current `connection`.

<RemoteCodeViewer
  route="examples/edges/custom-connectionline"

</ExampleLayout>
