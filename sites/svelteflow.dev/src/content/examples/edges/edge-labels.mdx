You can simply render an edge label by using the `<EdgeLabel />` component. You can simply pass the label positions to it that our path helper functions (`getBezierPath`, `getSmoothStepPath` etc.) returns and it will handle the rest. See [CustomEdge.svelte](#example-code).

If you need more control of your edge labels, you can use the `<EdgeLabelRenderer />` component. It's a portal component that lets you render edge labels (or anything you like really) on top of the edges container. `<Edge Label>` uses `<EdgeLabelRenderer />` internally. See [CustomEdgeStartEnd.svelte](#example-code).

If you want to mimic the behaviour of `<Edge Label>` you need to handle some things yourself:

- make sure the `<div />` you pass has `position: absolute;` and `translate(-50%, -50%)`
- to add mouse interactions you need to set `pointer-events: all`
- to select the node when clicking on the label you can call the `handleEdgeSelect` helper from the store via `useStore`
