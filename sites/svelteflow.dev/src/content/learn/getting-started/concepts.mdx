# Concepts

Take a couple of nodes and draw an edge between them: You got yourself a flowgraph. This might seem like a very brief definition, but it is the essence of what Svelte Flow solves:

- An interactive, infinite canvas
- You can position nodes on the canvas
- Nodes can be connected with edges
- It's just regular Svelte components

To get up to speed with the terminologies we use, check out the flowgraph below.

<RemoteCodeViewer
  framework="svelte"
  route="/guides/concepts/"
  showEditor={false}
  showOpenInCodeSandbox={false}
  showOpenInStackblitz={false}
/>

Some terminologies you need to be aware when we talk about working with Svelte Flow in your code:

- **Svelte Flow Component**: The main component that renders the flowgraph
- [**Svelte Flow Props**](/api-reference/svelte-flow): Configure Svelte Flow and pass data via its props
- **Viewport**: The visible area of the flowgraph, that can be panned and zoomed.
  - _"In the viewport"_ means something is moving with the transformation of the viewport.
- **Base Styles**: The minimal css that needs to be imported to make Svelte Flow work
- **Built-In Components**: Some additional plug and play components that are included in the package

```svelte filename="Flow.svelte"
<script>
  import { SvelteFlow, Panel, Minimap, Controls } from '@xyflow/svelte';

  // The Base Styles are the bare minimum css you need to import
  // import '@xyflow/svelte/dist/base.css';

  // We recommend the Default Styles, which include the Base Styles
  // and some initial styling for the nodes and edges.
  import '@xyflow/svelte/dist/style.css';
</script>

<!--
 This is the "Svelte Flow Component". It is the heart of your flowgraph.
 You pass your nodes & edges as well as all your options to it via props.
 We refer to them as the "Svelte Flow Props". There are a lot of them!
-->
<SvelteFlow
  fitView
  colorMode="dark"
  onconnect={() => console.log('Congrats, you connected two nodes!')}
>
  <!--
    Anything you render inside the Svelte Flow Component will be overlayed on the viewport.
    This is useful for things like panels, buttons and the minimap â€”
    everything that is fixed and should NOT move with the viewport.
  -->
  <Panel position="top-left">
    <h1>Welcome to Svelte Flow</h1>
  </Panel>
  <Minimap />
  <Controls />
</SvelteFlow>
```

Now you know everything you need to understand pretty much everything we refer to in the docs. Next, you'll learn everything about [**Nodes & Edges**](/learn/getting-started/nodes-and-edges).
