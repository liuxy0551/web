# Built-In Components

Svelte Flow comes with several additional components that you can plug into your flow. All you have to do is import and add them as children to the `SvelteFlow` component.

```svelte filename="BuiltInComponents.svelte"
<script>
  import { SvelteFlow, MiniMap, Controls, Background, Panel } from '@xyflow/svelte';

  import '@xyflow/svelte/dist/style.css';
</script>

<SvelteFlow>
  <MiniMap />
  <Controls />
  <Background />
  <Panel position="top-left">
    <h1>My Flow</h1>
  </Panel>
</SvelteFlow>
```

## MiniMap

Especially for bigger flows, a [`MiniMap`](/api-reference/components/minimap) can help with navigation. You can easily modify the appearance of each node by providing a `nodeColor` function.

<RemoteCodeViewer
  route="guides/built-in-components/minimap"
  framework="svelte"
  showOpenInStackblitz={false}
/>

## Controls

Svelte Flow comes with a set of customizable [`Controls`](/api-reference/components/controls) for the viewport. You can zoom in and out, fit the viewport and toggle if the user can move, select and edit the nodes.

<RemoteCodeViewer
  route="guides/built-in-components/controls"
  framework="svelte"
  showOpenInStackblitz={false}
/>

## Background

It is helpful for orientation to display a repeating pattern in the viewport. With the [`Background`](/api-reference/components/background) component you can choose between different variants. If you want to implement your own pattern or maybe even do more advanced things, take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/svelte/src/lib/plugins/Background/Background.svelte) for the `Background` component.

<RemoteCodeViewer
  route="guides/built-in-components/background"
  framework="svelte"
  showOpenInStackblitz={false}
/>

## Panel

To quickly overlay things on top of the viewport, you can use the [`Panel`](/api-reference/components/panel) component.

<RemoteCodeViewer
  route="guides/built-in-components/panel"
  framework="svelte"
  showOpenInStackblitz={false}
/>
