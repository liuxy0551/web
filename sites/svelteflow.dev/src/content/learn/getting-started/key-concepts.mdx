# Key Concepts

Take a couple of nodes and draw an edge between them: You got yourself a flowgraph. This might seem like a very brief definition, but it is the essence of what Svelte Flow solves:

- An interactive, infinite canvas
- Render nodes connected by edges on the canvas
- **It's all just regular Svelte components**

To get up to speed with the terminologies we use, check out the flow below.

<RemoteCodeViewer
  framework="svelte"
  route="/guides/concepts/"
  showEditor={false}
  showOpenInCodeSandbox={false}
  showOpenInStackblitz={false}
/>

Some terminologies you need to be aware when we talk about working with Svelte Flow in your code:

- **Svelte Flow Component**: The main component that renders the flowgraph
  - [**Svelte Flow Props**](/api-reference/svelte-flow): All configuration and data is passed as props
- **Viewport**: The visible area of the flowgraph, that can be panned and zoomed
  - _"In the viewport"_ means something is moving with the transformation of the viewport
- [**Base Styles**](/learn/customization/theming): The minimal css that needs to be imported to make Svelte Flow work
- [**Built-In Components**](/learn/getting-started/built-in-components): additional plug and play components that are included like Controls and a MiniMap

Now you know everything you need to understand pretty much everything we refer to in the docs. Next, let's [install Svelte Flow](/learn/getting-started/installation) and build our [first flow](/learn/getting-started/building-a-flow)!
